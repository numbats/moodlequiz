# R Markdown format for Moodle XML quizzes

Provides an alternative interface to working with the exams package for
producing Moodle questions any type.

## Usage

``` r
moodlequiz(
  replicates = 1L,
  self_contained = TRUE,
  extra_dependencies = NULL,
  theme = NULL,
  includes = NULL,
  lib_dir = NULL,
  md_extensions = NULL,
  pandoc_args = NULL,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- replicates:

  The number of times the questions are rendered, useful for producing
  multiple versions of the same quiz with different random samples. To
  keep identify replicates of questions for random importation into
  Moodle we recommend organising the materials into categories using top
  level headers.

- self_contained:

  Produce a standalone HTML file with no external dependencies, using
  data: URIs to incorporate the contents of linked scripts, stylesheets,
  images, and videos. Note that even for self contained documents
  MathJax is still loaded externally (this is necessary because of its
  size).

- extra_dependencies:

  Extra dependencies as a list of the `html_dependency` class objects
  typically generated by
  [`htmltools:htmlDependency()`](https://rstudio.github.io/htmltools/reference/htmlDependency.html).

- theme:

  One of the following:

  - A
    [`bslib::bs_theme()`](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/reference/bs_theme.html)
    object (or a list of
    [`bslib::bs_theme()`](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/reference/bs_theme.html)
    argument values)

    - Use this option for custom themes using Bootstrap 4 or 3.

    - In this case, any `.scss`/`.sass` files provided to the `css`
      parameter may utilize the `theme`'s underlying Sass utilities
      (e.g., variables, mixins, etc).

  - `NULL` for no theme (i.e., no
    [`html_dependency_bootstrap()`](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/rmarkdown/reference/html-dependencies.html)).

  - A character string specifying a [Bootswatch
    3](https://bootswatch.com/3/) theme name (for
    backwards-compatibility).

- includes:

  Named list of additional content to include within the document
  (typically created using the
  [`includes`](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/rmarkdown/reference/includes.html)
  function).

- lib_dir:

  Directory to copy dependent HTML libraries (e.g. jquery, bootstrap,
  etc.) into. By default this will be the name of the document with
  `_files` appended to it.

- md_extensions:

  Markdown extensions to be added or removed from the default definition
  of R Markdown. See the
  [`rmarkdown_format`](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/rmarkdown/reference/rmarkdown_format.html)
  for additional details.

- pandoc_args:

  Additional command line options to pass to pandoc

- ...:

  Additional function arguments to pass to the base R Markdown HTML
  output formatter
  [`html_document_base`](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/rmarkdown/reference/html_document_base.html)
