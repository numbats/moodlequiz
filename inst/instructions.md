Here's how to import a Moodle quiz XML file into a course so you can use its questions in a quiz.

### 1. Go to your course's Question bank
1. Log in to Moodle and open the **course** where you want to import the questions.
2. Turn **Editing on** if required (depends on your theme/permissions).
3. In the course:
   - Either go to **More → Question bank** (in newer Moodle versions),  
   - Or go to **Administration block → Question bank → Import**.

If you don't see "Question bank," you may not have the necessary teacher/editing rights.

### 2. Start the import
1. In the Question bank, click the **Import** tab.
2. Under **File format**, select **Moodle XML format**.
3. Under **General**:
   - **Category**: Choose the question category where the imported questions should be stored (or create a new category first in the Question bank → Categories).
   - Optionally check/uncheck things like "Get category from file" if you're using that.

### 3. Upload the XML file
1. In the **Import questions from file** section:
   - Click the **Choose a file…** or file picker button.
   - Upload your XML file (drag and drop, or use "Upload a file" and browse).
2. Once the file is shown in the file picker, click **Upload this file** (if applicable).
3. Back on the Import page, click **Import** at the bottom.

### 4. Review and confirm
- Moodle will process the XML and display a list of the questions found.
- Scroll down to verify there are no error messages.
- Click **Continue** at the bottom when done.

Your questions are now in the Question bank in the selected category.

### 5. Add imported questions to a quiz

To actually use them in a quiz:

1. In your course, **Turn editing on**.
2. Click **Add an activity or resource** and choose **Quiz** (or open an existing quiz).
3. Inside the quiz, go to the **Questions** or **Edit quiz** page.
4. Click **Add → from question bank**.
5. Choose the same **category** where you imported the questions.
6. Select the questions you want, then click **Add selected questions to the quiz**.
